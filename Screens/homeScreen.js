          We all love storiesâ€¦ All kinds of stories - science fiction, fiction,
          non-fiction as well as bedtime stories ! 
          So, I have developed a Story Hub App where all story lovers have access to read the stories and the
          writers have access to write the stories. You can go to the different
          sections of this app to read as well as write stories. But this app is
          not completed yet. Wait for the upcoming versions! :)

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  allText: {
    backgroundColor: '#00cbff',
    flex: 1,
  },
  displayText: {
    fontSize: 20,
    padding: 15,
  },
});
